He rushes to the Castle Winterfell, which is ruled by Eddard, who decapitates him for being a \"deserter\". In King's Landing, the capital, Jon Arryn, the \"Hand of the King\", dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert Baratheon, Eddard's former brother-in-law, travels to Winterfell, offering the position to him and also proposing marriage between Joffrey, the former's son, and Sansa, Eddard's daughter. Catelyn, Eddard's wife, receives a letter from her sister, Lysa, also Jon's widow, saying that she has escaped King's Landing and that he was murdered by the Lannisters, including Queen Cersei. Catelyn burns the letter and tells Eddard about it, believing that the Lannisters are plotting against Robert. Eddard's youngest son, Brandon, climbs above a tower, where he witness Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime, who pushes him to fall. Meanwhile across the narrow sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen makes a deal with the Dothraki warlord Drogo, who marries the former's sister, Daenerys, in exchange for providing the former with an army to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne."
