    "description": "The North secedes from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaims Robb as their king. With Jaime captured by the Starks and Robert's brothers challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne, Tywin appoints Tyrion as King's Hand. Snow plans to desert his post at the Wall to avenge Eddard, but his friends convince him to stay and he instead joins a Night's Watch expedition to find Benjen beyond the Wall. Yoren, a Night's Watchman loyal to Eddard, changes Arya's appearance and helps her escape King' Landing while Joffrey plans to make Sansa his queen by force. Daenerys learns that her unborn son is dead and Drogo has been left in a vegetative state due to the witch's treacherous magic. Daenerys ends Drogo's life and lights a funeral pyre. She burns the witch alive alongside Drogo's body and her three dragon eggs, and walks into the flames herself eventually. When the embers die the following morning, Daenerys rises, unharmed, flanked by three newborn dragons. Jorah and other witnesses kneel before her."
