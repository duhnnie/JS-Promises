    "description": "Robert appoints Eddard as the Hand again and tasks him to run the affairs until he returns from hunting. Some villagers arrive in the throne room, complaining about being attacked by a group, which Eddard deduces was led by Gregor, the knight who lost to Tyrell. They also deduce that Gregor was hired by Tywin, Cersei's father. Eddard sentences Gregor to death and sends a message to Tywin, summoning him to a trial. Eddard decides to return Sansa, who just reconciled with Joffrey, and Arya to Winterfell. Eddard finds out that Joffrey is not Robert's biological son. While riding a horse, Brandon is attacked by outlaws; but Robb, Eddard's other son, and Greyjoy, a henchman and son of a fallen rebellion leader, save him. In Vale, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, which Lysa accepts. She chooses Ser Vardis and Tyrion asks for a fighter, with only one volunteering, killing Vardis and having Tyrion released. Meanwhile, Viserys gets angry with Drogo for not honoring his promise and attempts to kill his baby inside Daenerys. Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold on his head."
