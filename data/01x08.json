    "description": "Arya manages to escape King's Landing by the help of Forel, who sacrifices himself. Sansa is captured however. Robb hears the news and prepares the Northern armies to fight the Lannisters, leaving Brandon behind to rule Winterfell. Lysa refuses to fight the Lannisters; and Catelyn leaves, joining Robb's camp. Tyrion and Bronn, the knight who fought for him in the Vale, are surrounded by Shagga and his men. Tyrion convinces them to escort him to Tywin to repay them. They arrive at Tywin's camp, where the latter asks Shagga to help them in their confrontation with the Starks in exchange for payment. Joffrey appoints Tywin as the Hand. Sansa begs the former to show mercy upon Eddard. Joffrey agrees if the latter recognizes his reign. At the Wall, some bodies affected by the White Walkers are found. In Essos, Drogo's soldiers begin attacking nearby settlements, enslaving locals in order to sell them and gain the money to buy the ships necessary to pass the Narrow Sea."
