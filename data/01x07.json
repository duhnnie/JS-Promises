    "description": "In King's Landing, Eddard tells Cersei about his knowledge that she is involved with Jaime and all of her children are his. The former learns that Robert was critically wounded by a boar. Robert names Eddard as the \"Protector of the realm\" to rule until Joffrey reaches the legal age. Eddard sends a message to Stannis, Robert's brother, intending to enthrone him since Robert does not have any true heirs. The former tells Baelish about his plan and asks him to gain the loyalty of the City Watch, the only force capable of overpowering Cersei's loyal warriors. After Robert's death, Eddard, Baelish and the City Watch confront Cersei and Joffrey in the throne room, where Baelish and the City Watch are revealed to be loyal to Cersei, attacking Eddard and his men. In the Wall, Benjen goes missing beyond. Snow and Tarly are picked as stewards, with the former assigned to Joer. The duo swear their loyalties to the Night's Watch. In Essos, Robert's assassin is captured before he can poison Daenerys. Drogo vows to conquer the Seven Kingdoms and give it to his son. He starts marching towards Westeros."
