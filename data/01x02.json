    "description": "Having accepted his new role as the Hand of the King, Eddard leaves Winterfell with his daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind to tend to Brandon, who lies unconscious, and is attacked by an assassin; but his direwolf saves him. Catelyn knows about the Lannisters' involvement in the attempts and decides to go to King's Landing to tell Eddard. Snow, Eddard's apparent illegitimate son, heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, protectors of the Wall that keeps the White Walkers and the wildlings from entering civilized Westeros. Tyrion, Cersei's brother, decides to forego the trip south with his family, instead joining Snow's entourage heading to the Wall. When Joffrey threatens Arya and her friend, one of her family's direwolves defends her and escapes, provoking a conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, with Robert ordering Eddard to execute another present direwolf. Brandon awakens from unconsciousness just after Eddard kills the direwolf. Meanwhile, Daenerys focuses her attention on learning how to please Drogo."
